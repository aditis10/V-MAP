# V-MAP

### ⚡What is it?
V-MAP is a full-stack web application which models and graphs the spread of COVID-19 in order to determine an optimal vaccination plan. Users can specify a number of available vaccines per day, which will be distributed by the algorithm to high-priority regions in the most effective mannar.

### ⚡Why is it relevant? 
V-MAP combats virus and vaccine related misinformation and provides the tools necessary to create an effective plan for vaccine rollout. By targeting the general public, it eases social, ethical, and political unrest amidst the critical state of India's healthcare system.

### ⚡How does it work?
V-MAP uses real incidence datasets to investigate various unique parameters of the outbreak and the effects of intervention strategies in India. Our modelling approach is rooted in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, which provides a theoretical framework to investigate the spread of an epidemic within a community. This mathematical model utilizes differential equations to compute the theoretical number of people infected in a closed population over time.

Users can interact with the model by changing the number of available vaccines and see how it will change case projections in the table.

Users can also click on the pins on the map to view an interactive chart for each region which displays both historical and projected data.
